This repository is for the work done in my SNHU CS 320 Software Test, Automation QA course

HOW CAN I ENSURE THAT MY CODE, PROGRAM, OR SOFTWARE IS FUNCTIONAL AND SECURE?

To accomplish this, I test my code, program and software. There are many ways to test, such as executing a complete program and using manual input to make sure it works as intended, or creating automated test files that simulate input to ensure the program works as intended.

HOW DO I INTERPRET USER NEEDS AND INCORPORATE THEM INTO A PROGRAM?

Looking at user needs, I can attempt to write the code to meet specifications. I then can create tests to check that the program behaves the way I intended and that it meets all of the users needs.

HOW DO I APPROACH DESIGNING SOFTWARE?

When designing software before this course, I focused mainly on what I wanted the program to do and how to make it do that. Now, I know I also need to think about what I want it to not do and how to make sure the program only does what I want, and what it should do instead of the things I don't want it to do. First thought is "What do I need this to do?" and the second thought is "What do I want to happen if it tries to do something it shouldn't?".
